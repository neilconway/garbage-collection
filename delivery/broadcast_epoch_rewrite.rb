# Reliable broadcast with a single sender and a dynamic set of receivers. We
# assume that receiver groups are "sealed" on epoch number -- that is, we learn
# about all the receivers in a given epoch simultaneously. That means that while
# new receivers can be added (in new epochs), the membership list of a given
# epoch is fixed. Moreover, each outbound message is tagged with the epoch to
# which it should be delivered. Outbound messages for not-yet-known epochs will
# be buffered until the epoch has been learned; also, new outbound messages for
# prior epochs can always be learned (and will be delivered correctly), since we
# don't try to reclaim node information for prior epochs.
#
# Note that we don't tolerate sender failure.
