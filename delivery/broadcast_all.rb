# Reliable broadcast with a fixed set of nodes that act as both senders and
# receivers. That is, any node can send a message; when a node receives a
# message, it rebroadcasts the message to all other nodes. This ensures that we
# can tolerate the failure of nodes that have partially completed message
# sends. We assume that all nodes configured with the same set of values in
# "node". To ensure that log entries are globally unique, they are identified
# with a pair: <creator-addr, id> (note that "creator" is the node that
# originated the log entry, which is often different from the node that sent a
# message containing that entry.)
