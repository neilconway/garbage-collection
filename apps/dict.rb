# An implementation of a replicated dictionary that uses reliable broadcast,
# similar to Wuu & Bernstein ("Efficient Solutions to the Replicated Log and
# Dictionary Problems", PODC'84).
#
# The system consists of a (fixed) set of nodes; each node has a complete copy
# of the log. Any node can add a new entry to the log, which will then be
# replicated to all the other nodes. Log entries are uniquely identified and
# consist of an operation (insert/delete), a key, and an optional value (for
# insertions). Log entries are used to construct a dictionary. Each node also
# keeps track of the knowledge at every other node; this information is used to
# reclaim log entries when we know that they have been delivered to all sites.
#
# We assume that there is at most one insert for a given key; hence, once an
# element has been deleted it cannot be reinstated. These semantics are similar
# to the "2P-Set" CRDT.
#
# Our goal is to (a) implement the positive dictionary logic (log broadcast +
# dictionary construction) (b) automatically infer the logic for both
# propagating knowledge about node state and reclaiming log entries.
#
# Differences from Wuu & Bernstein:
# (1) We don't assume that messages from A -> B are delivered in-order
# (2) We don't explicitly depend on stamping messages with the sender's clock;
#     i.e., we just assume that each message has a unique ID
# (3) (Possible) we might exchange common knowledge (what W&B call "2DTT") in a
#     different manner
# (4) We maintain insert and delete logs separately, rather than a single
#     unified log; this also means the ID sequences used by inserts and deletes
#     are not shared
#
# TODO:
# * try to prevent/handle multiple insertions of the same key?
# * look at different schemes for propagating common knowledge
#   (=> more efficient ACK'ing protocol, gossip, etc.)
