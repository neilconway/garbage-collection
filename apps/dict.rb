# An implementation of a replicated dictionary that uses reliable broadcast,
# similar to Wuu & Bernstein ("Efficient Solutions to the Replicated Log and
# Dictionary Problems", PODC'84).
#
# The system consists of a (fixed) set of nodes; each node has a complete copy
# of the log. Any node can add a new entry to the log, which will then be
# replicated to all the other nodes. Log entries are uniquely identified and
# consist of an operation (create/delete), a key, and an optional value (for
# creations). Log entries are used to construct a dictionary. Each node also
# keeps track of the knowledge at every other node; this information is used to
# reclaim log entries when we know that they have been delivered to all sites.
#
# Our goal is to (a) implement the positive dictionary logic (log broadcast +
# dictionary construction) (b) automatically infer the logic for both
# propagating knowledge about node state and reclaiming log entries.
#
# Differences from Wuu & Bernstein:
# (1) We don't assume that messages from A -> B are delivered in-order
# (2) We don't explicitly depend on stamping messages with the sender's clock;
#     i.e., we just assume that each message has a unique ID
# (3) (Possible) we might exchange common knowledge (what W&B call "2DTT") in a
#     different manner
#
# TODO:
# * how to handle/prevent/allow concurrent insertions of the same key?
# * look at different schemes for propagating common knowledge
