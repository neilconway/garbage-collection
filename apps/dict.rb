# An implementation of a replicated dictionary that uses reliable broadcast, in
# the style of Wuu & Bernstein ("Efficient Solutions to the Replicated Log and
# Dictionary Problems", PODC'84).
#
# The system consists of a (fixed) set of nodes; each node has a complete copy
# of the log. Any node can add a new entry to the log, which will then be
# replicated to all the other nodes. Each log entry has a unique ID. Insert log
# entries contain a <key, value> pair; delete log entries contain the unique ID
# of the insert to be removed. Log entries are used to construct a dictionary.
# Each node also keeps track of the knowledge at every other node; this info is
# used to reclaim log entries when they have been delivered to all nodes.
#
# Wuu & Bernstein assume that there will be at most one insert for a given key;
# hence, a delete references a _key_, and deleted elements can never be
# reinstated. Instead, we allow multiple inserts of the same key (the dictionary
# consists of all such non-deleted inserts). Deletes reference an insertion ID;
# once a given _ID_ has been deleted, it cannot be reinstated -- but another
# insert with the same key is allowed.
#
# Our goal is to (a) implement the positive dictionary logic (log broadcast +
# dictionary construction) (b) automatically infer the logic for both
# propagating knowledge about node state and reclaiming log entries.
#
# Differences from Wuu & Bernstein:
# (1) We don't assume that messages from A -> B are delivered in-order
# (2) We don't explicitly depend on stamping messages with the sender's clock;
#     i.e., we just assume that each message has a unique ID
# (3) (Possible) we might exchange common knowledge (what W&B call "2DTT") in a
#     different manner
# (4) We maintain insert and delete logs separately, rather than a single
#     unified log; this also means the ID sequences used by inserts and deletes
#     are not shared
# (5) As noted above, multiple inserts of the same key are allowed, and deletes
#     reference IDs, not key names.
#
# TODO:
# * look at different schemes for propagating common knowledge
#   (=> more efficient ACK'ing protocol, gossip, etc.)
